## Description

Friendly Wager allows users to create fake, friendly wagers to compete in a group against friends with a no monetary value point system. Users can create groups with friends and place wagers on NFL, NBA, and MLB matches before they occur. 

Odds for the matches are updated frequently and are from real sportsbooks, allowing the point system to be a decent reflection of actual sports betting ability.

Wagers are regularly graded automatically within 15 minutes after the sports matches are completed. 

## Getting Started

After downloading the app and opening it, the user is directed to the login page. Here, they can either log in with an existing account or
create a new account. If the user was previously logged in already, this screen will be skipped.

Once the user is successfully validated, they are brought to the interaction home screen. Here, they can add friends, create groups, or
accept/decline friend and group requests from other people. Groups allow you to create wagers and compare performance in the form of a
points leaderboard. Users can have at most 4 groups at a time.

If the user has any active groups, they can click on the group under the Groups tab to enter the group dashboard. Here, any member of the 
group can add their friends to the group, view leaderboards, create a wager, or view current active wagers. 

Under the Add Wagers tab of the group dashboard, users can add wagers for upcoming NBA, MLB, and NFL matches. Games for each are displayed,
and the user can tap on the game to create a wager with the corresponding odds. Once created, these wagers are viewable under the View Wager
tab, and exist there until the game ends and is processed by the system.
